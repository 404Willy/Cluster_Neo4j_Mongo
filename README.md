🚀 **NoSQL Database Cluster Playground**

Explore the world of NoSQL databases with this repository! 🌐 Here, you'll find the code for setting up Neo4j and MongoDB clusters, implementing key NoSQL features such as sharding, replication, fault tolerance, and high availability.

### 🗂️ Branches Breakdown:

- **`mongoDB-cluste`**: Dive into the MongoDB branch to discover the setup for sharding, replication, fault tolerance, and high availability, tailored for MongoDB.
- **`neo4j-cluster`**: Explore the Neo4j branch containing the equivalent configurations and implementations, custom-crafted for the unique characteristics of Neo4j.

### 🌍 What's Inside?

- **Sharding Magic**: Uncover the code that brings sharding capabilities to your NoSQL databases.
- **Replication Wonders**: Explore how replication is implemented to ensure data durability and availability.
- **Fault Tolerance Charm**: Delve into the world of fault tolerance with configurations designed to withstand failures.
- **High Availability Elegance**: Witness the setup for high availability, ensuring your databases are always ready to serve.

### 🛠️ How to Navigate:

1. Checkout the `mongoDB-cluster` branch for MongoDB-specific configurations.
2. Switch to the `neo4j-cluster` branch for Neo4j-tailored implementations.
